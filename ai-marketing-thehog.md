# The Hog Summary

AI-native Go-To-Market command center. Growth as a Service (GaaS) promising to replace marketing and sales teams. The Google Maps for customer acquisition. HOG = Head of Growth.

- **ICP Channel Finder** — maps where customers gather (LinkedIn, email, Reddit, niche communities, forums, events)
- **AI Agent Center** — specialized agents acting as fractional CMO, SEO, brand strategist
- **Social listening and competitor monitoring** across LinkedIn, Reddit, X, and review sites
- **AI-generated game plans** with daily actions, and content generation for blogs and SMM

A proprietary system called **The Hog Mind** — a *Contributory Global Graph* that fuses real-time social listening with identity resolution to surface buying signals before competitors.

Launched in late 2025 by CEO **Hudson Liao**, a non-technical guy with 15 years of GTM exp; CTO **Paulo Nascimento** — AI specialist holding a patent pending in multi-agent management.

**Funding:** the company entered **Y Combinator's Fall 2025 batch (F25)** — likely the standard deal with ~$500K — $125K for 7% equity + $375K SAFE).

**The team**: is currently just the two founders, though they're actively hiring a Founding Engineer ($120K-$180K, San Francisco) and a Senior AI Engineer ($40K-$85K, remote Latin America).

**Reported numbers**: 144 demo requests on day one, 100+ paying customers in two days, $15.5K MRR within the first week, and a $240K ARR sales pipeline (likely from YC's network).

**Marketing**: nearly all exposure comes from **YC's distribution infrastructure**: the YC launch page, company profile, jobs board. Almost zero coverage beyond that.

**Price**: $129-499 based on the number of projects, users, competitors tracked. No free tier. 

**Tech stack**: Next.js, React, TypeScript on the frontend, high-volume PostgreSQL and AWS on the backend, with the marketing site built on Framer and the app hosted at app.thehog.ai.
